# Description of the project
Fetch is a peaceful and immersive simulation game where you take a leisurely stroll through a scenic park with your loyal dog. Enjoy the simple joy of throwing a stick or ball and watching your dog eagerly chase after it. Along the way, take time to explore the environment, sit by the water, watch birds flutter by, or just soak in the calming atmosphere. This game is about finding happiness in small, everyday momentsâ€”just like in real life.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

I'm most proud of the fetch mechanic and the realistic, responsive interaction between the user and the dog. The way the dog reacts to the player's actions adds a strong sense of immersion and emotional connection, making the experience feel much more lifelike.

I'm also proud of how I designed the environment to closely simulate a real-life outdoor park. From the layout and lighting to the ambient sounds and natural movement of elements like grass and trees, every detail was crafted to enhance immersion and make the virtual space feel familiar and believable.
